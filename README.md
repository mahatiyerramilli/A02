PART 2

**Branch**: You use a branch when you want to build a feature on a repository. It won't affect the main code/repository
  
**Clone**: Just a copy of one of your repositories that is stored locally on your desktop. You can later let it update to the original copy in your github

**Commit**: Similar to a screenshot, but it is of your repository. If you make a commit everytime you make a major update, then over time all the commits you made will tell a story of the history of your repository

**Fetch**: Self explanatory term, it retrieves the last change made from the repository

**GIT**: The tool through which github repositories are used

**Github**: A web-based git repository with several features such as collaboration, bug tracking, and task management for projects

**Merge**: Combines changes from one branch to another, so the features spread through the entire code

**Merge Conflict**: Sometimes Git can't merge two branches, usually happens when you make changes to the same line in different branches

**Push**: When you update code to your GitHub from your local repository

**Pull**: To propose changes to a repository in a branch, so that the main branch only has approved work

**Remote**: The version of your repository that you access through the internet/website, like GitHUb

**Repository**: Where you store your code and files. There are separate files for how many projects you want to create.
